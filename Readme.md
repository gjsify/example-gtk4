### Misc classes to build Gtk4 Applications in python 3.9

It takes the hassle away from building Gtk4 application in Python
So you can create a cool application, without all the boilerplate code

 * main.py     is a sample application
 * widgets.py  contains classes to make it easy to create your UI

### Requirements (Fedora 34)
* gtk4
* python3-gobject
* Python 3.9 (or later)

Will properly work fine in other distros, but I have only tested in Fedora 34
